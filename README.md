# mancala-AI
 Basic mancala game with minmax algo AI (includes alpha beta pruning)

How To Play/Configure:
    
    Bottom row is the user while the top row is a minmax based AI with a current depth of 5

    To change which row is AI and which is user, comment and uncomment the respective code blocks labled in main.py

    To change the depth of the AI you can change the the second parameter value of the minimax function in main.py

    There is a current sleep function called in main.py after the ai_move function is called which is only there to see which moves the AI is performing and is completely optional
